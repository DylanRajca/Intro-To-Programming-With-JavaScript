1. Identify the data type for each of the following values:

'true' - string
false - boolean
1.5 - number
2 - integer
undefined - undefined
{ foo: 'bar' } - object

2. Explain why this code logs '510' instead of 15:
console.log('5' + 10);

  - JavaScript coerces 10 into a string and concatenates it with '5'.

3. Refactor the code from the previous exercise to use explicit coercion, so it logs 15 instead.

  - console.log(Number('5') + 10);

4. Use the template literal syntax along with the expression Number('5') + 10 to log the following sentence to the console:
The value of 5 + 10 is 15.

  - `The value of 5 + 10 is ${5 + 10}.`;

5. Will an error occur if you try to access an array element with an index that is greater than or equal to the length of the array?

  - No, JavaScript returns undefined.

8. Create an array named names that contains a list of pet names. 

  - let names = ['Darla', 'Binx', 'Luna'];

9. Create an object named pets that contains a list of pet names and the type of animal.

  - let pets = {
    'asta' : dog,
    'pudding' : cat,
    'darwin' : lizard
  };

10. What value does the following expression evaluate to?

  - false, since case matters when comparing strings.

11. What value does the following expression evaluate to?
parseInt('3.1415')

  - 3

11. What value does the following expression evaluate to?
'12' < '9'

  - true
